/ (root - LVMGroup-root):

    Size: 10 GB.
    The root directory contains the core operating system files and binaries. 10 GB is typically sufficient unless a lot of software is installed.

/swap (LVMGroup-swap):

    Size: 2.3 GB.
    Acts as virtual memory, used when the physical RAM is full. The size depends on your RAM, with 1x-2x RAM being a common rule of thumb.

/home (LVMGroup-home):

    Size: 5 GB.
    Stores personal user data like documents, configurations, and application settings. It can be resized later, depending on available storage and user needs.

/var (LVMGroup-var):

    Size: 3 GB.
    Used for variable data like logs, caches, and application-generated files. This helps prevent the system from crashing if logs or temp files grow unexpectedly.

/srv (LVMGroup-srv):

    Size: 3 GB.
    Contains data for services provided by the system, like web or FTP servers. You may omit this if your system doesnâ€™t host such services.

/tmp (LVMGroup-tmp):

    Size: 3 GB.
    Temporary files created by applications or users. Having it on a separate partition enhances security and avoids filling up the root filesystem.

/var/log (LVMGroup-var--log):

    Size: 4 GB.
    A dedicated partition for system and application logs. It prevents logs from filling up the / or /var partition and causing issues

ncrypted Partition (sda5_crypt):

    This indicates that the partitions under LVM are encrypted for enhanced security, especially useful for laptops or sensitive systems.

Recommendations for Partitioning a Future System:

    Adjust partition sizes based on your use case (e.g., increase /home size if you store a lot of user data).
    Consider a dedicated /var or /var/log if you run servers or expect many logs.
    Encryption (crypt) is highly recommended for laptops or systems with sensitive data.
