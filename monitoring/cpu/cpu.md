#CPU
    
The utility of a CPU (Central Processing Unit) refers to its effectiveness and efficiency in executing task in executing tasks or processing instructions. It indicates how well the CPU is being used relative to its capacity. In computing, the utility can be measured by the percentage of time the CPU is actively processing tasks processing tasks as opposed to being idle.
High CPU utility means the processor is working close to its maximum capacity, while low utility indicates underutilization/

Key factors contribution to CPU utility include:
* **Processing Power**: How quickly the CPU can execute instructions 
* **Task Load**: The number and complexity of processes being handled by the CPU.
* **Efficiency**: How well the CPU manages its resources, including power consumption and heat.

In a well-balanced system, the CPU utility should be high during tasks requiring significant processing power (e.g., gaming, data analysis) but not consistently running at full capacity to avoid overheating and inefficiency.
