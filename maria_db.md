# MariaDB

MariaDB is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is a fork of MySQL. It was created by the original developers of MySQL after concerns arose over MySQL's acquisition by Oracle.

## Key Features

1. **Open-source**: MariaDB is free to use, modify, and distribute under the GPL license.

2. **MySQL Compatibility**: MariaDB is designed to be a drop-in replacement for MySQL, meaning that most MySQL applications can switch to MariaDB without requiring significant changes.

3. **Performance**: MariaDB has been optimized for better performance compared to MySQL, especially in areas like query optimization, storage engines, and indexing.

4. **Storage Engines**: MariaDB supports multiple storage engines (such as InnoDB, Aria, and TokuDB), allowing flexibility in managing data.

5. **Scalability**: It supports high-availability configurations like clustering, replication, and sharding, which are useful for large-scale applications.

6. **Community-driven**: MariaDB is developed and maintained by the community, ensuring transparency and continuous improvement.

7. **Security**: MariaDB has advanced security features such as encryption, authentication plugins, and SSL support for secure connections.

## Summary

MariaDB is a robust, scalable, and community-supported alternative to MySQL, with improvements in performance and security.
