# Aptitude

Aptitude allows users to view the list of packages and perform package management tasks, such as installing, upgrading, and removing packages. Actions can be performed from a visual interface or from the command line.

The main difference between Aptitude and APT is the visual interface.

During a package conflict, Aptitude will suggest a resolution and then perform the task, whereas APT does not do this.

Aptitude can interactively retrieve and display the Debian changelog of all available official packages.
