# Debian

Debian is more stable, more robust, and has a lot of software available. It is a versatile option for both servers and applications.

Debian uses AppArmor as the primary Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system. AppArmor is easier to set up and manage.

Debian uses APT for package management, which is secure and efficient but does not offer the same level of flexibility, especially for the development of complex software.
