#SeLinux

SELinux is a security module that supports security policies related to access control.

It is supported by Rocky and Debian.

Rocky OS integrates it better. Rocky provides more software to improve the SELinux experience, such as sealert, which translates SELinux denial messages into a more understandable format and provides troubleshooting steps. (This tool is not present on Debian.) SELinux is widely considered more flexible and robust, offering fine-grained controls and rule configurations.

It has a different package manager, yum, which is flexible and easy to use. It supports automatic dependency resolution, versioning, and modular content.

Rocky has more frequent updates, ensuring access to new software more quickly. Combined with its high degree of compatibility with RHEL, Rocky is a potentially better OS for business.
